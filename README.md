UrbanOracle is an AI-driven Digital Twin platform that simulates, monitors, and predicts real-time urban conditions such as traffic congestion, air quality, weather, and disaster alerts.
It provides city-scale situational awareness and predictive intelligence to support smart city planning, sustainability, and emergency response.
This project demonstrates how AI, real-time data, simulation models, and forecasting can be combined into a unified city management system.
Why UrbanOracle?
Modern cities generate massive amounts of data, but most city dashboards are:
Reactive, not predictive
Fragmented across departments
Difficult to simulate future scenarios
UrbanOracle solves this by offering:
A unified city model
AI-based predictions
What-if simulations

Actionable insights for planners and citizens
